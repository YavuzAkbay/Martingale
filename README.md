# üöÄ ML-Enhanced Martingale Stock Analysis Tool 

A financial analysis tool that combines traditional martingale theory with modern machine learning techniques to provide enhanced stock market predictions and investment insights. This project implements an advanced stock analysis system that leverages multiple neural network architectures to detect market regimes, predict volatility, and forecast price movements. Unlike traditional martingale analysis, this tool incorporates machine learning models to adapt to changing market conditions and provide more accurate predictions.

  - Volatility Predictor: Deep learning model for forecasting future market volatility
  - Price Predictor: Advanced LSTM with attention mechanism for price movement predictions
 
- üìä Advanced Analytics

  - Feature Engineering: 20+ technical indicators and market features
  - Risk-Return Analysis: Comprehensive risk assessment with ML-enhanced metrics
  - Regime-Aware Predictions: Adaptive forecasting based on current market conditions
  - Multi-Factor Analysis: Incorporates volume, volatility, technical indicators, and market correlation

- üìà Visualization & Insights

  - Interactive Charts: Comprehensive visualization dashboard with 12 different analytical views
  - Prediction Confidence Bands: Visual representation of prediction uncertainty
  - Feature Importance Analysis: Understanding which factors drive predictions
  - Performance Comparison: Traditional vs ML-enhanced approach comparison
